`<p>The tab presents data on offences as reported through the PSNI Recorded Crime System:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sexual offences;</li>
    <li>Violence against the person; and</li>
    <li>Stalking and harassment;</li>
</ul>
<p>The location is based on where the offences take place.</p>`,

`<p>Statistics on police recorded crime in Northern Ireland are collated and produced by statisticians seconded to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).</p>
<p>While the PSNI does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Home Office, the practices and procedures of the Home Office’s notable offence list are followed and applied within Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The Crime recording process starts at the point at which an incident comes to the attention of police. This may be brought through a call for service from a member of the public, an incident being referred to the police by another agency or being identified by the police directly.</p>
<p>This data is available on the <a href="https://ppdata.nisra.gov.uk/table/PRCPD" target="_blank">NISRA Data Portal</a>.</p>
<p>Statistical publications can be found on the <a href="https://www.psni.police.uk/about-us/our-publications-and-reports/official-statistics/police-recorded-crime-statistics" target="_blank">relevant publication page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Updates:</strong> Data updated quarterly. <strong>Last update:</strong> ${update_date}.</p>`,

`<p>This tab displays maps showing where offences occurred, based on police-recorded data.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What it tells us:</strong> It highlights the geographic location of the offence itself, not where the victim lives. This distinction is important because offences can happen away from home—for example, in public spaces or workplaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Understanding where offences occur helps identify hotspots and inform targeted prevention efforts, policing strategies, and community safety initiatives.</li>
    <li><strong>How to use it:</strong> Use these maps to guide local interventions, resource deployment, and awareness campaigns in areas with higher recorded incidents.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Location data reflects where the offence was recorded, which may differ from where it began or where the victim resides. It does not indicate risk for individuals living in that area.</li>
