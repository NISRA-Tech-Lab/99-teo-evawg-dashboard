            `<p>The <strong>Young Life and Times (YLT) Survey</strong> defines gender-based violence as “violence, abuse and harm directed against a person because of that person’s gender, or violence that affects people of a particular gender disproportionately.”</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Violence:</strong> Being beaten, slapped, pushed, or restrained.</li>
    <li><strong>Sexual Violence:</strong> Upskirting, unwanted touching, or being coerced into sexual acts.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological Violence:</strong> Being insulted, stalked, harassed, controlled against your will, or threatened with violence.</li>
    <li><strong>Online Violence:</strong> Receiving threats online or via social media, online trolling, or being sent or asked for intimate images against your will.</li>
</ul>`,

`<p>The <strong>Young Life and Times (YLT) Survey</strong> records the attitudes and opinions of 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland about the issues that concern them. It is a representative annual survey that has been running since 2003.</p>
<p>To assess experiences of, and attitudes to, violence against women and girls, The Executive Office (TEO) sponsored the inclusion of relevant questions in the YLT survey from 2023.</p>
<p>The survey is completed online between April and May each year. Due to demand for questions, the survey is split into two versions; the version containing the Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) module is completed by approximately 1,000 16-year-olds annually.</p>
<p>This data is available on the <a href="https://ppdata.nisra.gov.uk/table/EXPVLYTHEQ" target="_blank">NISRA Data Portal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong> Data updated annually. <strong>Last update:</strong> ${update_date}.</p>`,

`<p>This tab presents findings from the Young Life and Times survey, capturing the views and experiences of young people in Northern Ireland regarding violence and abuse.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What it tells us:</strong> It highlights how young people perceive issues such as domestic abuse, coercive control, and gender-based violence, and whether they have experienced these behaviours themselves. These insights reveal emerging patterns and attitudes among younger age groups.</li>
    <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Early attitudes can shape future behaviours. Understanding young people’s experiences and beliefs helps identify risks and opportunities for prevention before harmful norms become entrenched.</li>
    <li><strong>How to use it:</strong> Use this data to inform education programmes, awareness campaigns, and safeguarding policies in schools and youth settings. It can guide interventions that promote healthy relationships and challenge harmful behaviours.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Responses are self-reported and may understate sensitive experiences due to stigma or reluctance to disclose. Figures should be considered alongside qualitative research and other sources for a fuller picture.</li>
