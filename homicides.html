                    <p>Questions relating to gender-based violence have been included in the <strong>Young Life and Times (YLT)</strong> survey since 2022 to attempt to gain more understanding of the prevalence of gender-based violence in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>The YLT is a representative survey of 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland, and respondents are provided with definitions of gender-based violence. The data from this survey represents self-reported experience of gender-based violence.</p>
        <p>After initial question development, a time series will be developed in future years from a baseline in 2023. Economic violence was not asked in the YLT survey due to the age of respondents.</p>
